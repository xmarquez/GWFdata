<dl><dt>cowcode</dt>
<dd><p>Correlates of War country code. Countries  that have changed
territory during the period from 1946 to 2010 have the following country
codes in this data set: Czechoslovakia (315); East Germany (265); Ethiopia
(530); Eritrea (531); Russia and Soviet Union (365); South Vietnam (817);
South Yemen (680); Vietnam/North Vietnam (816); Yemen/ North Yemen (678);
Yugoslavia/Serbia (435). Note that regimes that either lost (Ethiopia) or
gained territory (Vietnam/North Vietnam) during the lifetime of the regime
have the same country code throughout the entire regime spell. Users should
note this feature of the data set when merging with other data sets.</p></dd>


<dt>year</dt>
<dd><p>calendar year</p></dd>


<dt>gwf_country</dt>
<dd><p>name of country</p></dd>


<dt>gwf_casename</dt>
<dd><p>a country name and set of years during which an
autocratic regime was in power. An autocratic regime is defined as a set of
formal and/or informal rules for choosing leaders and policies; there can be
multiple regimes within an autocratic spell. An autocratic spell is the
consecutive calendar years in which some autocratic regime ruled the
country; autocratic spell may be interrupted by years in which a democracy,
foreign occupier, or failed state controlled the majority of the territory.</p></dd>


<dt>gwf_caseid</dt>
<dd><p>a unique identifying number for each autocratic regime in
power on January 1 of consecutive observation years within the same
country.</p></dd>


<dt>gwf_case_duration</dt>
<dd><p>a counter variable that marks the number of years
the autocratic regime has been in power, up to and including the observation
year; duration = 0 in the calendar year the autocratic regime took power;
duration = 1 in the calendar year for the first calendar year in which the
autocratic regime holds power on January 1. Duration time includes years the
autocratic regime held power prior to 1946 for independent countries. There
is therefore no left-censoring in the data.</p></dd>


<dt>gwf_case_fail</dt>
<dd><p>a binary indicator variable for whether the autocratic
regime fails (i.e., collapses or ends) in the observation year.</p></dd>


<dt>gwf_leadername</dt>
<dd><p>the name of the regime leader on January 1 of the
observation year. A regime leader is the de facto leader of the autocratic
regime. Some autocratic regime leaders are in power less than a year and are
not in power on January 1 of an observation year. These leaders are omitted
from the data set.</p></dd>


<dt>gwf_leaderid</dt>
<dd><p>a unique identifying number for each regime leader on
January 1 of the observation year. A regime leader is the de facto leader of
the autocratic regime.The same individual may be regime leader in more than
one autocratic regime. For example, Joaquin Balaguer is considered the
regime leader of Trujillo's regime in 1962 after Trujillo's assassination in
1961. Balaguer is also the regime leader of a distinct regime from 1966 to
1978. (He is coded as such starting in 1967 because the codings are based on
who is in power on January 1 of an observation year.) The leader id variable
treats each leader episode as a distinct regime leader. Further, the same
individual can be regime leader more than once within the lifetime of the
same autocratic regime. For example, Crown Prince Faisal (he became King in
1964) is considered the regime leader in Saudi Arabia in 1959 and 1960, as
well as for a second longer stint from 1962 to his (natural) death in 1975.
The leader id variable treats these leader episodes as distinct. We
encourage users to utilize this unique identifier instead of the leader
names because the latter contain some names shared across regimes and
different sources spell names differently.</p></dd>


<dt>gwf_leader_duration</dt>
<dd><p>a counter variable that marks the number of years
the regime leader has been in power, up to and including the observation
year; duration = 1 in the calendar year for the first calendar year in which
the regime leader holds power on January 1. Duration time includes years the
regime leader held power prior to 1946 for independent countries.</p></dd>


<dt>gwf_leader_fail</dt>
<dd><p>a binary indicator variable for whether the regime
leader on January 1 of the observation year exits the regime leadership
position in the observation year. All regime failure events entail
leadership failure: 223 observation-years in the data are coded as regime
failure events; 469 observation years contain leadership failure events.
Thus more than half of leadership failures are in observation years during
which an autocratic regime does not collapse.</p></dd>


<dt>gwf_case_startdate</dt>
<dd><p>numeric code for the calendar date of the
political event that constitutes the start of the regime.</p></dd>


<dt>gwf_case_enddate</dt>
<dd><p>numeric code for the calendar date of the political
event that constitutes the end of the regime.</p></dd>


<dt>gwf_case_prior</dt>
<dd><p>a categorical variable indicating the regime type
prior to the observed regime-case:</p><ul><li><p>democracy: the country was an independent, sovereign country before the
observed autocratic regime took power and the regime that preceded it was
democratic as coded by Geddes, Wright and Frantz (2014).</p></li>
<li><p>dictatorship_mil: the country was an independent, sovereign country before
the observed autocratic regime took power and the regime that preceded it
was autocratic and led by the military, as coded by Geddes, Wright and
Frantz (2014).</p></li>
<li><p>dictatorship_nonmil: the country was an independent, sovereign country
before the observed autocratic regime took power and the regime that
preceded it was autocratic and was NOT led by the military, as coded by
Geddes, Wright and Frantz (2014); this includes states such Ethiopia prior
to 1889 and Nepal prior to 1846 that were ruled by prior dynasties.</p></li>
<li><p>foreign-occupied: the country was occupied by a foreign military power
before the observed autocratic regime took power; this includes cases such
as U.S. occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq after U.S. invasions, post-WWII
regimes created by conquering super-powers, including Soviet satellite
states such as East Germany.</p></li>
<li><p>not-independent: the country was not an independent, sovereign country
before the observed autocratic regime took power; this includes
post-colonial/protectorate regimes, post-Soviet regimes, and regimes in
countries that secceeded from larger countries, such as Bangladesh and
Eritrea.</p></li>
<li><p>warlord: the country's territory was ruled by warlords without a central
government prior to the observed autocratic regime.</p></li>
</ul></dd>


<dt>gwf_leader_firstyear</dt>
<dd><p>the first year the regime leader was in power on
January 1 of an observation year. This variable is coded to coincide with
the first year of each leadership spell (accounting for left censoring) of
an autocratic leader. For example, Hugo Chavez' first year is coded as 2006
since the autocratic regime started in 2005, even though his first year in
office was 1999 while the country was still democratic.</p></dd>


<dt>gwf_fail_subsregime</dt>
<dd>
<ul><li><p>Coded 0 if the regime has not ended by December 31, 2010.</p></li>
<li><p>Coded 1 if the regime that follows the last year of the regime being coded
is democratic. Democratic is defined as a regime in which the executive
achieved power through a direct competitive election in which at least ten
percent of the total population (equivalent to about 40 percent of the adult
male population) was eligible to vote, all major parties were permitted to
compete, and neither fraud nor violence determined the election outcome; or
indirect election by a body at least 60 percent of which was elected in
direct competitive elections (defined in the same way as for directly
elected executives) Provisional governments charged with conducting
elections as part of a transition to democracy are coded democratic if the
elections actually take place and if the candidate and party elected are
allowed to take office. This sometimes takes more than a year. If a
provisional government is following the rules agreed to with regard to power
sharing and preparing for a fair election, and it lasts through January 1 of
the year following its creation or longer, but is later ousted by a group
different from the incumbent group that preceded it, code it as democratic
(defined as above) during the time it governed. Reconvening a legislature or
constituent assembly previously elected in a competitive election for the
purpose of managing a transition to democracy is coded as democratic if the
transition is carried out.</p></li>
<li><p>Coded 2 if the regime in the year following the last year of the regime
being coded is autocratic, that is, included in our autocratic data set.</p></li>
<li><p>Coded 3 if the regime is followed by a period that is neither autocratic
nor democratic. These include: Periods in which the country has no
government or has multiple governments, no one of which controls most of the
resources of the state; periods in which foreign troops occupy the country
and the occupying power governs it, or exercises major influence over how it
is governed; failures that occur when a country ceases to exist because it
has been incorporated into another (e.g., East Germany, South Yemen).</p></li>
</ul></dd>


<dt>gwf_fail_type</dt>
<dd>
<ul><li><p>Coded 0 if the regime had not ended by December 31, 2010.</p></li>
<li><p>Coded 1 if regime insiders changed the rules for choosing leaders and
policies, or the executive was removed by elite actors other than the
military, ending the period of time in which one set of formal and informal
rules remained in force. Use this code for cases in which regime insiders
changed the formal or informal rules under which elections were held such
that, for example, all parties could participate or suffrage was extended to
most of the population, thus changing the identity of the actors who could
influence policy. Examples might include transitions from indirect military
rule to democracy and transitions from oligarchy to democracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Coded 2 if the incumbent, or a party, coalition, or candidate supported by
the incumbent, lost an election and allowed the candidate or party that won
to take office.</p></li>
<li><p>Coded 3 if a regime held a competitive election in which no major
candidate or party supported by the incumbent ran, as a means of choosing
the next government, and allowed the winner of the election to take office.
Also use this code if the incumbent group handed power to a transitional
government for the purpose of holding an election to determine the next
government – even if the transitional election did not ultimately occur – as
long as democratization was not prevented by the current incumbent.</p></li>
<li><p>Coded 4 if the regime was ousted by popular uprising. Popular uprising is
defined as widespread, mostly unarmed demonstrations, riots, and/or strikes.</p></li>
<li><p>Coded 5 if the regime was overthrown by military coup (defined as ouster
by the military of the regime in power). Overthrows by insurgencies led by
ex-officers are coded as insurgencies not coups. Handovers to the military
in the context of popular uprisings, where the military acts as a
facilitator of regime change, are coded as popular uprisings not coups.
Transitions from direct to indirect military rule are coded as coups because
they are made by the military of the regime in power.</p></li>
<li><p>Coded 6 if regime is ousted by insurgents, revolutionaries, or combatants
fighting a civil war. Insurgency, revolution, or civil war defined as
involving organized armed conflict.</p></li>
<li><p>Coded 7 if regime changed through foreign imposition or invasion.</p></li>
<li><p>Coded 8 if a new leader chosen in a regular autocratic succession changed
the formal and informal rules defining the regime after his accession to
power while himself remaining in power. If the regime's formal and informal
rules were changed sufficiently to code it as a new regime, it will appear
in the list of cases as a separate entry. Regular autocratic successions
defined as: the retirement, illness, or death of the original leader and his
replacement by someone who previously occupied the formal position of
successor, or was selected by the retiring leader, or was chosen by a group
of regime insiders such as the party executive committee, high level
officers, or a combination of the two. Regular autocratic successions also
include original leaders who leave office because of term limits and are
succeeded by a leader chosen by the retiring leader; or a group of regime
insiders such as the party executive committee, high level officers, or a
combination of the two.</p></li>
<li><p>Coded 9 if regime ends because the state ceases to exist or the government
loses control of most of its territory.</p></li>
</ul></dd>


<dt>gwf_fail_violent</dt>
<dd>
<ul><li><p>Coded 0 if the regime had not ended by December 31, 2010.</p></li>
<li><p>Coded 1 if non-violent, defined as involving no deaths.</p></li>
<li><p>Coded 2 if a few deaths occurred during the transition. If numbers are
available, 'a few' means 1-25.</p></li>
<li><p>Coded 3 if many deaths occurred during the transition. If numbers are
available, 'many' means more than 25 but less than 1000.</p></li>
<li><p>Coded 4 if more than 1000 deaths occurred. (These should be included in

</dl><p>NOTE: This data set does not include a categorical variable for regime type.
An autocratic regime type is one of the categories or typologies that group
similar autocratic regimes together. A regime type indicator is time
invariant across a regime's duration; examples include: military, party,
personalist, and monarchy. Those interested in using the autocratic regime
type data should consult: Barbara Geddes, Joseph Wright, and Erica Frantz.

<p>When using the data to model autocratic regime survival, the unit of
analysis is the autocratic regime, which is coded in the variable
<code>gwf_casename</code>. The unit of analysis for authoritarian regime survival is
not the autocratic spell or the regime leader spell. See Geddes, Wright and
Frantz (2014) and Wright and Bak (2016) for discussion of differences in
modeling autocratice regime survival and leader survival.</p>
<p>Algeria</p><ul><li><p>1962-1992: FLN/military</p></li>
<li><p>1992-2010: military rule</p></li>
</ul><p>The autocratic spell lasts from 1962 to 2010 and is right-censored. Each
bullet point lists a distinct autocratic regime. Regime failure (<code>gwf_fail</code>)
occurs in 1992: the January 11, 1992 military coup that ousted Benjedid. The
autocratic regime from 1992-2010 is right-censored because it has not failed
as of December 31, 2010. Algeria has six autocratic regime leaders during
this period, three in the first regime (Ben Bella, Boumediene, and Benjedid)
and three in the second regime (Nezzar, Zeroual, and Bouteflika).</p>
<p>Chile</p><ul><li><p>1973-1989: military junta rules under Pinochet</p></li>
</ul><p>The autocratic spell lasts from 1973 to 1989; it is not right-censored. The
bullet point lists one autocratic regime. Regime failure (gwf fail) and the
autocratic spell failure occur in 1989. Only one regime failure (<code>gwf_fail</code>)
event occurs at the end of the autocratic spell:   the December 14, 1989
election that leads to democracy the following year. There is only one
regime leader (<code>gwf_leadername</code>) during this period: Pinochet.</p>
<p>Congo/DRC/Zaire</p><ul><li><p>1960-1997: Mobutu regime</p></li>
<li><p>1997-2010: Kabila (father and son) regime</p></li>
</ul><p>The autocratic spell lasts from 1960 to 2010 and is right-censored. Each of
the bullet points lists a distinct autocratic regime. Regime failure occurs
in 1997. Only one regime failure event occurs during the autocratic spell:
May 17, 1997 when Laurent Kabila's forces take Kinshasa. The autocratic
regime from 1997-2010 is right-censored because it has not failed as of
December 31, 2010. There are three regime leaders during this autocratic
spell, one in the first regime (Mobutu) and two in the second (Laurent
Kabila and Joseph Kabila).</p>
<p>Thailand</p><ul><li><p>1944-1947: Pridi regime</p></li>
<li><p>1947-1957: Phibun regime</p></li>
<li><p>1957-1973: Sarit, Thanom and the military</p></li>
<li><p>1976-1988: Prem Tinsulanonda and the military</p></li>
<li><p>1991-1992: military junta</p></li>
<li><p>2006-2007: military junta</p></li>
</ul><p>There are six autocratic regimes and four autocratic spells; none are
right-censored. Each bullet point lists a distinct autocratic regime. The
first three autocratic regimes (1944-1947, 1947-1957, and 1957-1973) ruled
consecutively, uninterrupted by a non-autocratic regime, and thus constitute
one autocratic spell: 1944-1973. The other three autocratic regimes
(1976-1988, 1991-1992, and 2006-2007) each ended in democracy and thus
constitute separate autocratic spells. There are nine autocratic regime
leaders during the sample period: one in the first regime (Pridi); one in
the second (Luang Phibun Songkhram); two in the third (Sarit and Thanom);
three in the fourth (Sangad Chalayu, Kriangsak, and Prem Tinsulanonda); one
in the fifth (Suchinda Kraprayoon); one in the sixth (Sonthi).</p>

<p>Military attributes</p>
<p>There are five ways that the data code military attributes, as summarized in
Table 1. Note that different variables pertain specifically to the regime
leader's career prior to assuming office, while others refer to the group
that put the leader in power or the type of event through which the regime
seized power.</p>
<p>Table 1: Military attributes</p><table class="table table"><tr><td>Variable name</td><td>Concept</td></tr><tr><td><code>leadermil</code></td><td>regime <em>leader</em> is a member of the military prior to assuming office, not a civilian or rebel leader</td></tr><tr><td><code>militrank</code></td><td>officer rank of regime <em>leader</em> prior to assuming power if he was a member of the military at this time; ranks include generals, colonels, and junior officers/NCO's</td></tr><tr><td><code>ldr_group_military</code></td><td>military is the organized <em>group</em> that put the regime leader into office</td></tr><tr><td><code>ldr_exp_highrank</code>, <code>ldr_exp_lowrank</code></td><td>regime leader's most important career experience, where he is most likely to have developed his most useful support network</td></tr><tr><td><code>seizure_coup</code></td><td>the regime seized power in a coup, meaning that the political event used to code the start of the regime is a successful coup</td></tr></table><p>The first variable in Table 1 identifies whether the regime leader was a
member of the military or security service prior to assuming office; that
is, the leader was not a civilian or rebel leader prior to assuming office.
This is derived using the leaderciv variable in the raw data set and is
referred to as <code>leadermil</code> in the codebook and cleaned data. This variable
is therefore very similar to the Cheibub, Gandhi and Vreeland (2010) coding
of military regimes, which relies on the Banks data that codes the
civilian-military distinction of the leader prior to his assuming office.</p>
<p>The second variable identifies the military officer rank of the leader if he
was a member of the military prior to assuming power. This is militrank in
the raw data, code book, and cleaned data. There are two leaders in the data
set who are coded as being members of the military prior to assuming office
but who were not ranking officers (Najibullah in Afghanistan and Sargsian in
Armenia); they were security officials but not formal members of the
military so they are not coded as having military rank.</p>
<p>The third variable identifies the group that put the regime leader into
office. This is derived from the <code>leaderrole</code> variable in the raw data; it
is referred to as <code>ldr_military</code> in the codebook and cleaned data. A value
of 1 on this variable does not mean that leaders placed in power by the
military were necessarily members of the military and/or military officers
in the five years prior to assuming office. For example, we code Abdelaziz
Bouteflika in Algeria and Francois Duvalier in Haiti as being placed in
power by the military even though they were not members of the military in
the five years prior to assuming office. Similarly, members of the military
(in the five years prior to assuming office) may be put into the leader
position by groups other than the military. For example, Raul Castro, a
high-ranking Cuban military officer prior to assuming office, was put in the
leadership position by his family. Empirically, however, those most likely
to be put into office by the military are members of the military,
particularly officers.</p>
<p>The fourth variable related to the military is the regime leader's most
important career experience, where he is most likely to have developed his
most useful support network. This is derived from the <code>ldrexp</code> variable in
the raw data and is referred to as <code>ldrexp_highrank</code> and <code>ldrexp_lowrank</code> in
the codebook and clean data. Again, most leaders whose prior experience is
based in the military will be members of the military prior to assuming
office. However, some members of the military prior to assuming office, such
as Anastasio Somoza Debayle and Raul Castro, are not coded as having their
most important prior career experience in the military. Instead, their
support network is identified as their family.</p>
<p>Finally, the data include a variable that codes the type of regime seizure
event, or how the regime obtained power. This is derived from the seizure
variable in the raw data and referred to as <code>seizure_coup</code> in the codebook
and cleaned data. Note that this variable is time-invariant across leaders
from the same regime. While most leaders who were military members prior to
assuming power occupy the leadership position in regimes that grabbed power
via a coup, some regimes born of coups did not put members of the military
in the leadership position. For example, the third leader of the Algerian
military regime, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, was put in charge of a regime that
came to power in a 1992 coup. Conversely, some members of the military
(i.e., individuals who are not civilians or rebel leaders) were given
leadership positions in regimes that seized power by methods other than a
coup, such as Joseph Kabila.</p>
<p>Some regimes in the data set are coded as having no professionalized,
domestically-controlled military, as listed in Table 2. A regime can be
without a professional domestic military under regime control for a number
of reasons, but the most common are the following. A foreign power either
provides security (e.g., Senegal provided security for Gambia until the late
1980s) or controls the military (e.g., Eastern European countries after WWII
or Central Asian Republics shortly after independence from the former Soviet
Union). The latter situation, where a collapsing empire gives way to
independent countries, is closely related to other instances of observing no
regime-led military: initial post-independence years in some African
countries (e.g., Botswana, Congo-Brazzaville, Ghana, Guinea, and Zambia).
Finally, Costa Rica does not have a military and Honduras did not have a
professional military until 1948 (Dodd 2005, 55-56). Afghanistan under
Taliban rule is also coded as not having a professional military
organization because the Taliban did not transform its informally organized
insurgent armed forces into a formal military institution after seizing
power.</p>

military-related variables are coded as not having a particular military
feature. For example, ethnicity in the military is coded as 0 for all
variables measuring this concept (<code>milethnic_dom</code>, <code>milethnic_hetero</code>,
<code>milethnic_homo</code>). When a regime does not have a professional military, this
does not necessarily mean the regime does not have a paramilitary group
(<code>paramil_party</code>, <code>paramil_pers</code>, <code>paramil_fightrebel</code>); nor does it
preclude the leader from consolidating power over the security apparatus
(<code>milmerit_pers</code>, <code>milnotrial</code>, <code>sectyapp_pers</code>). For example, the UAE did
not have a regime-led military until 1985, but promotion in the security
apparatus was still based on personal loyalty to the leader prior to 1985
(Cordesman 1997, 297). And more than a handful of regime leaders (e.g.,
Banda in Malawi, M'Ba in Gabon, and Zayid in the UAE) took personal control
over the security apparatus (<code>sectyapp_pers</code>) or created a new paramilitary
(<code>paramil_pers</code>) loyal to themselves (e.g., Tombalbaye in Chad, Karimov in
Uzbekistan) prior to the regime building its own army or replacing foreign
officers with national ones. Finally, even when a foreign power has direct
control over the military, the regime may still have military officers
present in the cabinet (e.g., East Germany and Poland in the early 1950s).</p>
<p>A regime can be coded as not having a support party if: a) the regime did
not come to power with the support of a pre-existing party and the regime
has yet to create a new support party; or b) the regime disbands (closes
down) an existing regime support party. If a regime does not have a support
party, some variables coded for party features of the regime cannot be
logically true. For example, if there is no support party it cannot be a
rubber-stamp party (<code>partyrbrstmp</code>); the party cannot control the military
(<code>partymilit</code>); the cabinet cannot contain members of the party
(<code>partymins</code>); the regime leader cannot be the party leader (<code>partyleader</code>);
and the heir cannot be selected from the party (<code>heirparty</code>). However, the
coding of the data allow for the possibility that a regime can have a leader
whose main prior experience is as a member of a dominant political party
(<code>ldrexp_supportparty</code>), a leader whose initial base of support that put him
in power was a dominant party (<code>ldr_domparty</code>), or a leader was selected in
an election. Since these variables pertain to the leader they can be coded
positively even when the regime does not have a support party. For example,
some post-Soviet leaders' main prior experience and initial bases of support
were via a (prior) dominant party – i.e. that of the Soviet Union – even
though they either the leader left that party or it was disbanded before the
regime took power. And many leaders were selected in elections even though
the dictatorship had no ruling party.</p>

    <h2 id="party-genealogy">Party genealogy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#party-genealogy"></a></h2>



<p>The data set codes the history of regime support political parties
(<code>partyhistory</code>):</p><ul><li><p><code>noparty</code> no support party</p></li>
<li><p><code>postseizure_party</code> created after seizure of power</p></li>
<li><p><code>priorelection</code> prior party, created to support the autocratic leader's
election before the initiation of dictatorship (e.g., Fujimori of Peru)</p></li>
<li><p><code>priornosupport</code> prior party, never won more than 10 percent of electoral
support</p></li>
<li><p><code>priorwinsupport</code> prior party, won support under prior autocracy</p></li>
<li><p><code>insurgent</code> insurgent/rebel party before initiation of dictatorship</p></li>
<li><p><code>priordem</code> prior party won more than 10 percent of support in a prior
democracy</p></li>
</ul><p>There is another variable that codes a military leader's relationship to
parties (<code>militparty</code>). This variable captures whether a regime leader from
the military – i.e., a regime leader who was an active duty or retired
military/security officer (or NCO) prior to accession to power – created a
political party to support himself and the regime. With this variable, we
derive the following variables:</p><ul><li><p><code>noparty</code> regime leader's supporters are not organized in a party</p></li>
<li><p><code>ally_regime</code> leader allies with a pre-existing party after his accession
to power. The only difference between <code>ally</code> and <code>priorparty</code> (see below) is
that the dictator is allied with the old party before assuming office for
<code>priorparty</code>, but after assuming office for <code>ally</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>newparty</code> regime leader or a close ally creates a party to support the
regime after his accession to office</p></li>
<li><p><code>priorparty</code> regime leader's supporters were organized into a party prior
to his accession to power, and that party now supports the regime</p></li>
</ul><p>There is a large overlap between <code>militparty_newparty</code> and
<code>partyhistory_postseizure</code> but this overlap is not perfect because the
latter refers to the party while the former refers to the behavior of the
leader if the leader's main prior experience is in the military. An example
from the Torrijos regime in Panama (1968-1982) illustrates this. After a
decade in power Torrijos created a new party in 1978 (coded as starting on
January 1, 1979). Thus both <code>militparty_newparty</code> and
<code>partyhistory_postseizure</code> are coded as 1 starting in 1979. However,
Torrijos died in 1981 and Flores succeeded him (and is coded as the new
leader starting in 1982). The <code>partyhistory_postseizure</code> variable is still
coded as 1 in 1982 because Flores kept the support party that was created
post-seizure of power (i.e. post-1968 when the regime seized power). But
<code>militparty_newparty</code> is coded as 0 for 1982 under Flores because he did not
create a new party; that is the behavior of the second regime leader
(Flores) was different from that of the first (Torrijos) insofar as the
first created a new support party while the second did not and instead used
the support of a party he inherited from his predecessor. In these cases,
<code>partyhistory_postseizure</code> is coded 1, while <code>militparty_newparty</code> is coded
0 and <code>militparty_priorparty</code> is coded 1. These instances arise most often
when the first regime leader creates a new support party after the regime
seized power but the second regime leader retains the support of this
post-regime seizure party.</p>
<p>While most regimes where the first leader comes to power with a pre-existing
party organized to run for office in the election just prior to the
initiation of dictatorship (e.g., Francois Duvalier in Haiti and Heydar
Aliyev in Azerbaijan) are not military officers just prior to seizing power,
there is one instance in which a leader's primary prior experience was as a
high-ranking military officer (Jose Antonio Ramon in Panama (1954-1955))</p>
